# MediKart

This app is made with a target to provide users with generic medicine instead of branded medicine so that the overall cost spent on medicine doesn't go over-budget.

The app functions in such a way that when user enters any branded medicine name then its generic along with the searched medicine is provided with all the profit margins and available manufacturers.

Also the user can place their order directly on it same as they do it on any e-commerce website but prescritions are checked before any further deliveries.
